# 👨‍💻 📈

Hello world! I currently maintain the open source ruby gem Sorcery and work
on various other projects, most of which I try to open source as well.

If you need to reach out to me, please either create an issue on the appropriate
project repository or connect with me on LinkedIn.

Many of my larger projects are still works-in-progress, and are private for the time being. For now,
here are some public examples of my work that you can view:
